# URL Shortener Microservice

This project is a microservice for shortening URLs, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB using Mongoose. It allows users to input a long URL and receive a shortened version that redirects to the original.

## Features

- **URL Shortening**: Users can submit a long URL and receive a unique shortened URL.
- **Redirection**: Visiting the shortened URL automatically redirects the user to the original URL.
- **URL Validation**: The microservice validates that the submitted URL is in the correct format.
- **Persistence**: Original and shortened URLs are stored in a MongoDB database.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing URLs.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
